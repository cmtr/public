**The Way We Work**

We define our selves as a **_Independent Generalist Advisory Service_** which is closely tied to our values as followes: 

* The _independence_ is reflected in our company valeus as *Take **Ownership** and Always act with **Integrity***. This is how we act. 
* The _generalist_ approach is reflected in our company's values as *Be **Curious** to all things and **Dive Deep** in to the matter*. This how we learn and improve.
* The _advisory_ perspective is reflected in our company's values as *Be nice to **People** and **Inspire** greatness in others*. This is how we work together.

To implement this in the day to day way we work, we use _THe Guiding Model that Drives All Our Efforts_. The model guides us in the areas of which we work - the instersection between *business, technology, organization* and *people* - and guides us by allways considering all things from the following it's four perspectives.

The Guiding Model consist of 

by allways considering things from the following for perspectives:
* **Business** - Why it is created
* **Organization** - How it is created
* **Technology** - What is created
* **People** - Who it is created by and for

#### Business
The business perspective represents the why of the endevour. Why a product is being created or why a project is being performed. This encompases the clients need and reason for performing the endevour.  

> “A brilliant solution to the wrong problem can be worse than no solution at all: solve the correct problem.”
>  
> Donald A. Norman, The Design of Everyday Things

#### Organization
The organizational perspective represents the how of the endovour. How are organize the resources, both people, capital and technology, to achieve the objectives of the endevour. 

This encompases the resources, people, processes, artifacts, ceremonies, capital, methodologies that are needed to meet the needs of the business. 

> “Norman’s Law: The day the product team is announced, it is behind schedule and over its budget.”

> Donald A. Norman, The Design of Everyday Things

#### Technology
The technology perspective representents the what of the endevour. It also set contraints of 

> “The problem with the designs of most engineers is that they are too logical. We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way we would wish it to be.”
> 
> Donald A. Norman, The Design of Everyday Things

Alternative

> “It is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand people. It is not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless dictates of machines.”
> 
> Donald A. Norman, The Design of Everyday Things


#### People
The people perspective represent the whom of the endevour. It is the people it's created by and the people it's created for. It is directly related to all the three other categories.

>“The vicious cycle starts: if you fail at something, you think it is your fault. Therefore you think you can’t do that task. As a result, next time you have to do the task, you believe you can’t, so you don’t even try. The result is that you can’t, just as you thought.”

We also want to give credits to Donald A. Norman for the influence his work has guided the work way we work and would encourge all our clients to read his book [The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things).

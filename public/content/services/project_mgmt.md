In todayâ€™s competitive business world, you need steady and experienced management to guide your strategies. *Product Management* and *Project, Program & Portfolio Management* are very important and complimantary domains that - yet distinct - are often interchangeably confused by all levels of business executives.

We provide advisory services to help you tailor your *Governance* for *Product, Project, Program or Portfolio* to meet requirements for your organization. Our advisors will join and help you to tailor, implement and socialize the methodologies - from predictive to agile - that best suits your company, product, culture, team and risk.

### Predictive vs. Agile
Waterfall (predicitive) all the way

### Standards from the Project Management Institute

Our advisors are knowledgeable and certified by (Project Management Institute)[https://www.pmi.org/] in their domain. The company has by policy decided to rely primarilly on the *PMI Standards for Project, Program and Portfolio Management* as they fit the companys profile of being individual (tailorable), generalist (broad) and advisory (guidelines) based. This does however not mean that we limit our selfs to them and ignore the lessons from competing standars and frameworks.

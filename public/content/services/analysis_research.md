Business Analysis is the practice of enabling change in an organizational context, by defining needs and recommending solutions that deliver value to stakeholders.

### Analysis & Research - Business, Market and User
Job titles for *business analysis practitioners* include not only *business analyst*, but also *business systems analyst, systems analyst, requirements engineer, process analyst, product manager, product owner, enterprise analyst, business architect, management consultant, business intelligence analyst, data scientist*, etc. The same can also be said for a *UX Desigers* and *Market Analyst*. All these professions, including management, *project management, product management, software development, quality assurance and interaction design* rely heavily on the same analysis and research tools, techniques, methodologies and skills for success. Although a *Business Analyst*, *Market Analyst* and *User Analyst (UX Designer)* have different priorities and objectives - and may argue hows techniques and methodolgies it is - the job analysis and research are performed in much the same way.


Business analysis is used to identify and articulate the need for change in how organizations work, and to facilitate that change. As business analysts, we identify and define the solutions that will maximize the value delivered by an organization to its stakeholders. Business analysts work across all levels of an organization and may be involved in everything from defining strategy, to creating the enterprise architecture, to taking a leadership role by defining the goals and requirements for programs and projects or supporting continuous improvement in its technology and processes.

Business Analysis is a disciplined approach for introducing and managing change to organizations, whether they are for-profit businesses, governments, or non-profits.

### The value Business Analysis & Research 
According to [PMIâ€™s Pulse of the Profession](https://www.pmi.org/learning/thought-leadership/pulse/core-competency-project-program-success) 47% of unsuccessful projects fail to meet original goals due to poor requirements
management. In the another [Pulse Report](https://www.pmi.org/learning/thought-leadership/pulse/pulse-of-the-profession-2017) 39% of failed projects identify inaccurate requirements gathering as a primary cause of failure. It further found that those organizations that demonstrate maturity in business analysis practices are 55% more successful in implementing strategy and are much more likely to achieve the expected value from the investments made on programs and projects. 

Organizations that follow mature business analysis practices will deliver better results and do so more efficiently and effectively than peer organizations with immature practices.

Organizations are often tempted to provide solutions before fully understanding a situation. Business analysis
enables the organization to identify and fix the root causes of problems instead of repeatedly addressing symptoms
as they occur.

### MANAGING RISK AND REDUCING REWORK
What constitutes sufficient business analysis is dependent on the risk appetite of the organization and the level of confidence required before the organization is comfortable proceeding with its initiatives. The decision to proceed without performing sufficient business analysis and accepting a higher level of uncertainty is often the result of undervaluing business analysis activities. Although business analysis requires considerable time and resources, if overlooked, it can result in insufficiently understood requirements, missed stakeholder expectations, and frustration
on the part of the project team and other key stakeholders. These issues can lead to much rework and many requests for change. It may seem counterintuitive, but taking the time to conduct business analysis actually saves time, reduces costs, and minimizes risk exposure in the long run.


### EFFECTS OF PRODUCT DEFECTS
When insufficient time is allocated to business analysis activities, gaps in requirements can arise. Missing and misunderstood requirements can lead to product defects. Product defects uncovered within the confines of the project
result in rework, but if these product defects are uncovered once a product is released to the consumer, the results are exponentially worse.

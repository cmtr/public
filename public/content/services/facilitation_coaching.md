### Facilitation

Facilitation is a set of skills to be used in working with a group, enabling and supporting them to achieve their objectives in a way that involves and respects all contributions, builds ownership and releases the potential of the group and its members. It helps differentiate between process and content.

You don’t have to be a “facilitator” in order to use facilitation methods and techniques. Many managers, elected and appointed leaders, educators, IT workers, researchers, consultants, etc. draw on the values, principles and practices of facilitation to engage more effectively and enrich the experience of colleagues, students, clients, participants.

### Coaching

Coaching is a process that aims to improve performance and focuses on the ‘*here and now*’ rather than on the distant past or future.

* coach as expert
* coach as a facilitator of learning

There is a huge difference between teaching someone and helping them to learn. In coaching, fundamentally, the coach is helping the individual to improve their own performance: in other words, helping them to learn.

* To help a person change in the way they wish and helping them go in the direction they want to go.
* Coaching supports a person at every level in becoming who they want to be.
* Coaching builds awareness empowers choice and leads to change.

#### Not Coaching

**Consultancy**
A consultant provides expertise and solves business problems, or develops a business as a whole. A consultant deals with the overall organization or specific parts of it and not individuals within it. Consultants only indirectly affect individuals.

**Teaching**
Teaching passes knowledge from teacher to student. The teacher knows something the student does not. The opposite is true in coaching. The client is the expert and the client has the answers, not the coach.

**Training**
Training is the process of getting knowledge skills or abilities by study, experience or teaching. The trainer by definition is the expert, and the training course is likely to be targeted on specific skills for immediate results. Training is also likely to be one to many rather than one to one.

**Therapy**
Therapy is working with the client who seeks relief from psychological or physical symptoms. The client wants emotional healing and relief from mental pain. Therapy deals with the client’s mental health. Coaching deals with the client’s mental growth. The client’s motive for entering therapy or counseling is usually to get away from pain or discomfort, rather than moving towards desired goals. Coaching is not remedial, it is generative. Both therapy and counseling are more likely to involve understanding and working with past experience than coaching.

**Counseling**
Counseling is working with a client who feels uncomfortable, or dissatisfied with their life. They are seeking guidance and advice. A counselor works remedially on a client’s problem.

**Mentoring**
Mentoring is when a senior colleague, seen as more knowledgeable and worldly wise gives advice and provides a role model. Mentoring involves wide ranging discussions that may not be limited to the work context. A mentor is a sponsor with great professional experience in their client’s field of work. Both mentoring and coaching are concerned mainly with achievements in the present and the future.

### Product
A **product** is anything that can be offered to a market to solve a problem, or to satisfy a want or need. Products have a cycle that consists of multiple stages. First, the product is conceived, then developed, then introduced and managed in the market, and finally, the product is retired when the need for it diminishes. Products are usually developed by a product team.

Product Management is an organizational function within a company that deals with the planning, forecasting, and production or marketing of a product or products at all stages of the product life cycle.

Product Managers are responsible for:
* Gathering and prioritizing product and customer requirements
* Defining the product vision
* Working with sales and marketing to ensure revenue and customer satisfaction goals are met


### Project, Program & Portfolio Management
A **project** is a temporary endeavor that is undertaken to create a unique product or service. With a project, there is a clear definition of what needs to be delivered by a specified date in time. Like in the previous item, projects are usually carried out by a project team. 


Project Management, on the other hand, consists of the application of processes, methods, knowledge, skills, and experience to achieve the objectives of a specific project.

The ultimate goal of a Project Manager is to aim to maximize quality while minimizing risk.

Responsibilities that fall under a Project Manager include:

* Building a product
* Adding new features to an existing product
* Creating new versions or extensions of a product
* Managing a team of designers and developers, and tracking their work
* Keeping the project on time and within budget while giving transparency to the client
* Using a variety of tools to accomplish their task. These include apps like Invisionapp, Dashable, Basecamp, Trello, and Github.

### Destinction
It’s important to note that a product can only be developed within the context of a project, and multiple projects can occur within a product’s life cycle. Unlike with a project, with a product, there is no clear definition of what has to be delivered. Customer needs naturally evolve over time, and products must evolve to serve customer needs. Project and Product Managers must understand this clearly.

With products, there are no clear deadlines or an end date, so Product Managers move around in a unique way. A customer expects a product to meet their needs right now, not at some distant point in the future. Thus, product development is not a temporary or occasional endeavor. It is a continuous process of delivering new features and improving a given product over time to satisfy changing user needs.

Project and product management are similar concepts. Both are problem solvers, but in order to create a successful product, you need to understand how these concepts differ. Only by doing so will you guarantee your business goals. 

Project management focuses internally to achieve specific objectives and complete a given project on time and under budget. Once the project is completed, it is no longer ‘managed.’

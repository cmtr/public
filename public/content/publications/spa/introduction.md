The *Strategic Pyramid* or *Strategic Management Pyramid* comes in many forms and is common occurance in *Product Management, Brand Development, Business Strategy, Change Management* and more. 

The objective of this series is to provide actionable recommendations for performing a the  Strategic Pyramid Analysis and whether is suitable for you. 

The target audience for this article is toward endevours by individual entrepenures or small businesses or product teams. It may also be helpfull for larger business that is immature in the area, but it will not cover the added complexities such organization have with high amount of stakeholders and organizational change management. 

### Why is it important?
Andrew Grove, former CEO of Intel, states in his book [*High Output Management*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/324750.High_Output_Management) that the value of a report is not in it's consumption, but in it's creation. When writing a report, or performing a analysis, the details are checked and any logical inconsistencies uncovered are addressed. So the simple answer to why it is important is: **validation**. *External* validation of you, your company to existing and potential customers, and more importantly *internal* validation to youself and endevours members.

#### Is it always good to perform such exercise?
The short answer for this question is NO. 

#### Internal Maturity
It firstly depends on your teams discipline to perform it themselves and live by it afterwards. If there is strong doubt about the teams ability to do this, then save your money and effort. 

#### Purchasing Structure
If your buyers are large industrial companies with institusionalized purchasing departments, there is mainly one questions they needed to know the answer to: "Does your products and services save us money or help us make more?"

If your buyers are private consumers or individual decision makers, they can be significantly more influenced by a good story and presentation. 

> **Special Note:** 

> * We differentiate here between *the buyers* - the people with authority to sign the contract - and *the client* - the people who use the proudcts or services. Their preferences may not be the same.

#### The Characteristics of What You Offer
Is your product specialized or generalized? Certain specialized products, services and companies are have a very clear objective: To make money doing the thing only we know. Others, like bottled water or vodka, are essentially the same and the only differentiating factor is to match your products values and image with the percieved self image of you customers. In the first case, a thourgh analysis wont make much difference, but for the other it's essential.

Then where does freelancer and consultants fall into this landscape? It's clear people are different, but jobs are the same. If you are a developer specialized in a given ERP solution, your knowledge and skillset falls towards the specialized side. If you are primarilly working with people, such as in project/product management and UX design, then your knowledge and skillset to the generalized side.

### Considerations to make before starting

There is many considerations you should take before starting. We'll go through a few of these here.

#### Who should participate in the analysis?

When starting such a task is to remember that it's a team effort. People different values and perspectives. If you are a solo freelancer without a team, use the people close to you (and they'll be glad to help).


#### Should you use external help to perform the analysis?
The short answer to this question is NO. 

The Strategic Pyramid is a favourite amoung *Management Consultants*, and as with much of their work, it's often something that is percieved as fancy, flashy and shallow rather than something that is actually usefull or lived by. Even though it has a bad reputation - most often due to lack of ownership in the recieving organization - but done right it can act as a strong power amplifier.

*Mangement Consultants* and *Professional* that specialize in these types of analysis is in fact very experienced and knowledgeable. So, why shouldn't you use external help? It's all about having "*skin in the game*". They are experienced at the analysis, but they are rarely experienced at the execution in the context of your business. In addition, their incentives does not always align with the company's objectives. A internal resource that owns the process and analysis will have to live with the consequences throughout it's execution and life span. He will - over time - have the knowledged about the unique minute details about the companys culture and ways of working that can makes the difference between success and failure.

Having a external facilitator is acceptable, but the best option is to use a internal facilitator (or train one if needed). If a facilitator is used, then it is especially important that they are exactly that, a facilitator (and a coach). If they also perform the analysis you will lose ownership to the process in the long run.

Is there situations where using external help for the analysis is beneficial? Yes, there is many. Sometimes you actually want a fancy, flashy and shallow analysis. E.g. when you have a product that is highly specialized and sell on merit and value alone, but it's a pre-requesite for complaiance, marketing or to be taken serious by certain stakeholders (such as investors, customers, employees, competitors, the public, etc.) a shallow analysis may be just what you need.

There is also the situation where you want to train a internal resourse to do the role, but want a experienced resource to bring them quickly up to speed. 

#### Consensus, Democracy or Totalitarianism
The processes and techniques described in this series promoto the use of consensus as a descision making technique. Where not possible, people will ten to strive for a more democratic technique such as majority rule. Most businesses are neither democratic nor consensus based, they are totalitarian with one person being the final decision maker. Experience tells that if the team comes to a conclusion that the descision maker does not fully support, then the work will shift to his original idea after some time. It's better to give *The Decision Maker* the veto power from the start. 

If *The Decision Maker* is given veto power and final say, it's very important that all participants give their opinions, input and votes before he can. The meeting foucs is to broaden and influence *The Decision Makers* perspective and opinion.

### Performing a Strategic Pyramid Analysis
The basic approach is to analyze and define each level of the pyramid step by step, and then apply the *Dimond method* of first creating a *discovery phase* with where divergence, beadth and individuality is promoted, before transitioning to a *convergence phase* where group thinking and consensus is promoted. The benefit of this method is that firstly everyone gets the opportunity to individually contribute to the outcome (without fear of group exclusion) and then as individuals group together about the final outcome.

**Figure 1:** Strategic Pyramid

The strategic pyramid, or strategic management pyramid, comes in many forms. What is common for them all is that is starts with the aspirational level at top with focus on the core belifs of the endevour. It further expands down to the achievable level defining the direction and identity. And in the end lands at the specific and tangable level actionable short.

>**Terminology**

> The Strategic Pyramid Analysis is most commonly associated in the use of a business or brand, but it's also applicable for ideal organizations, products or services, brands, individual persons that is endevouring to do something. The definition of *endevour* as a verb is *"try hard to do or achieve something"* and as noun a *"an attempt to achieve a goal"*. And we'll use this term to describe the undertaking in this series. For the endevours participants can also have many forms, such as employees, team or individual, we'll accordingly use the term *member* to describe these (def. *"a person, animal, or plant belonging to a particular group"*).

### Values
The endevours values are the ethics, beliefs, philosophies, and principles that drive your it. It's quite simply what does the endevour stand for?

Having clear values for your endevour is the first step to ensure that all the endevours members and stakeholders are working towards the same goals. This  doesn't mean having a polished communication plan around nice values and principles. To benefit from them it's necessary to truly honor the  endevour values in everything it does and for the leadership to set the right example for it's members and stakeholders. Every decision for the endevours should strive to aligne with these values. It's the only then they can work as a way can build lasting trust.

The core values further supports the endevours vision and mission in forming its culture. 

### Vision
The endevours vision describes the desired long-term results of it's efforts. It describes the where of the endevour. It is the inspiration and guide for the endevour's members, e.g. the company's employees or the product team, but can also to other stakeholders. The vision should motivate the members to make a difference and be part of something bigger than themselves.

### Mission
The endevours mission are based in the present and designed to convey to both members and stakeholders of the endevour why the it exists, what it does and  who it does for.

The mission is used by the endevour to explain, in simple and concise terms, its purpose for being. It is generally short, either a single sentence or a short paragraph.

The big difference between the vision and the mission is that the first is aspirational and the latter is actionable.

### Strategic Objectives
Strategic objectives are the big-picture goals for the endevour. They describe what the endevour will do to try to fulfill its mission. Strategic objectives are usually some sort of performance goal—for example, to launch a new product, increase profitability, or grow market share for the product.

The strategic objectives define:
* How are we goint to progress?
* Which pains are we addressing?
* What goals do we want to achieve?
* In what order are we going to do it?


### Actions & Metrics
* What do we have to do?
* How do we know?
* Actions, Owners, Timeframes, Resources and Outcomes.


# The Rise of a Purpose Statement

The mission statement, vision, and values are traditionally the three most common descriptions of a business that explain why a company exists. In recent years, another type of statement has also emerged in the business world and is gaining more popularity. This type of statement is called a purpose statement.

A purpose statement conveys a company’s reason for existence, just as the mission statement and vision do, but it also shows the connection between the brand identity and workplace culture of the company. It combines the components of a mission statement, vision, and values into a single statement.

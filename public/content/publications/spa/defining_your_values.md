The *Strategic Pyramid* comes in many forms and is common occurance in Product Management, Business Strategy, Change Management and more. It's a favourite amoung Management Consultants, and as with much of their work, it's often something that is percieved as fancy, flashy and shallow rather than something that is actually usefull or lived by. Even though it has a bad reputation - most often due to lack of discipline and ownership in the recieving organization - but when done right it can act as a strong power amplifier.

This is *Part 2* of in a series going through the Strategic Management Pyramid. In this article we will focus on *Defining your Product or Business Values*.

### Defining the Endevours Values

Somethinge here about defining values

### Selecting the Participants
A endevour is a team effort. People have different values, belifes, perceptions and ethics. And the values should reflect the entire endourves values. 


If you are a solo freelancer without a team, use the people close to you.

The workshop agenda will be:

* Part 1 - Silent Brainstorm 
* Part 2 - Silent Review
* Part 3 - Silent Grouping
* Part 4 - Open Review
* Part 5 - Prioritization
* Part 6 - Reflection

##### Part 1 - Silent Brainstorm
Using the *dimond method* we start with the discovery and divergence phase.  
The objective here is to get as many relevant values as possible from the group.

The first step is to let each individual, in their own way define the values that is important for them. The important thing here is to prevent cooperation and group thinking. Hence the participants should not be allowed to speak to each other or peek at eachothers sticky notes. A common way is to provide each participant with a block sticky-note, a pen and the instructions to write down as many of values they can think of within a given time, usually 2-4 minutes. 

**Special Notes:**

* For the best outcome, all the sticky-notes should have the same color. The pen should also be the same type and color. Preferably a thick filt-tip pen. 
* People not used to working with abstracts - like values - may have difficulty defining them. It may be helpfull to instruct them to define scenarios or situations instead. E.g. instead of "Open", someone can write "I would like to work in a place where employees can talk to their managers with without fear."
* If the group or team is inexperienced with silent brainstorming, the participants may return only a few results. In that case, it may be helpfull for the facilitator to perform to collect values from the industry in general, companies you like to compare your self with or aspire to be. These should be prepared before the session and be clearly marked that they wasn't part of the team effort. The best way is to use a sticky-note of a different color.

##### Part 2 - Silent Review
The participants will now be asked to take their sticky-notes and put them on the wall. Usually, people tend to put their own notes grouped together, but there is no rule as to where they are placed. After all participants have displayed their sticky-notes on the wall or whiteboard. 

When all the sticky-notes have been placed, the participants will be instructed that they have 3-5 minutes to review each others values. There is not hard timelimit for this stage. The participants should be given sufficient time to take in the information.

If the facilitator see there is few suggestions, this is the time to introduce the prepared values from other companies. It's best to let the participants first to review their own before placing the prepared ones.

> **Special Note:**
>
>* The facilitator should document the placement of the notes. E.g. by taking a picture.
> * If the exercise is performed online - see list of online tools below - the facilitator should take a screenshot.

##### Part 3 - Silent Grouping
The silent grouping is simply letting the participants move the values together without being allowed to speak to each other. Everybody has the right to move a sticky-note and put it where they think it belongs. A sticky-note can be moved several times. The exercise finished once the group stops moving the sticky-notes.

>**Special Notes:**
>
>* After the participants have grouped together the different items, the facilitator should review and think of a common theme for the different groups. The facilitator should however not share this view until after the open review. 
>* The facilitator should take a picture of the whiteboard or wall at this stage to document the teams result.

##### Part 4 - Open Review
This part markes the end of the *discovery phase* and the beginning of the *convergence phase*. We change the focus from individuality and will embraze techniques to emphasize group thinking. The objective of this is that each inidividual shall have a stake in the groups outcome, and thus have a stronger commitment to the outcome (even if they individually disagree with some points of it).  

The participants will now get the chance to explain or ask questions about what people meant about the stickies. The facilitator should also ask the group what their reasoning about the grouping was and if everybody agrees with the explaination provided. The facilitator should then present the teams they found amoung the values and listen to the teams assement of the evaluation. The faciliator should then help the team define the themes of their groupings. 

>**Special Notes:**
>
>* If you have a lot of duplicates, this could be a good opportunity to eliminate them. If traceability is desireable, you could select different color sticky-note and mark it with how many stickies it replaced.  

##### Part 5 - Prioritization
To prioritize and identify the values the team find most important, we'll start with the *dot voting technique*. Each participant will get a equal amount of small stickers each representing one vote. The participants are free to spend their votes as they please. This includes not spending them, as well as using multiple votes for the same item. 

>**Special Notes:**
>
>* The facilitator needs to evaluate how many stickers to give each participant based on  
    * the amount of values proposed
    * the desired amount of end values
    * how many iterations or eliminations rounds will be performed to come to the end result.
>* If elimination is done over several rounds, then the facilitator can choose to let all sticky notes stay or remove the one not voted for.
>* If the workshop have selected to use a all powerfull *Decision maker*, then it's important that the decision put their vote down after all the other participants.

##### Part 6 - Reflection
We have now narrowed down our values to workshop outcome. It's now time to reflect on both the outcome and the process so far. It is here important to give every participant the opportunity and safety to express themselves. The facilitator should let the participants speak freely about how they feel and think about the outcome first. To emphasize the psychological safety of the participants he should first let all the participants speak honestly, but stop the participants from critizing each others reflection. 

Once everybody have given their personal reflection, the floor is open to critizim or further reflection based on what others ahve said.  

This concludes this phase of the workshop, but it does not conclude the end of the reflection. The participants should now get some time to think about the outcome on their own. The time between the workshop and the follow-up session should at minimum be one week and include a period of leasiure time (e.g. weekend). This is so the participants have time to reflect and let their subconsious can process the experience.  

To help the participants reflect, the facilitator/analyst should send a copy of the materials/artifcats and let them know there will ge a follow-up session within a given time.

>**Special Notes:**
>
>* Good dialog starters can be questions such as:
    * Do the participants agree with it? 
    * Was it what they imagined at the beginning?
>* This is also a great time for the facilitator to solicit feedback for how they thought the exercise went and what can be done better in the future.
>* If the workshop have selected to use a all powerfull *decision maker*, the decision maker should speak last.
>* The participants may use the time between the workshop and review to dicuss the process and the outcome among themselves. The individual participants should be able to reflect in the manner that suits them best, so the facilitator should neither encourage nor discourage such behaviour. 

##### Part 7 - Analyze & Refinement
During the workshop, the analyst have collected the artifacts/materials generated during the workshop and taken notes abuot the participants. It is now time for to analyze, reflect and find common themes and messages that reflect values the participants have generated and prioritized.

The objective of the analysis is to apply a structured and unbiased look at the materials generated during the workshop. There is no clear process for how the analyzis is performed as it's very dependent on the context, result and analyst preference. Some may prefer to do it as a solo effort and some as part of a group excercise. The main objective is to try and look at the material generated during the workshop to create a actionable outcome. This may be finding common themes or developing a example messages or stories that reflect the values of the group. 

Depending on the requirements, the outcome may be

* Just the single work values.
* Messages or stories to convey context of the values.
* Example behaviours in context of the company the shows them in effect.
* Presentation materials to communicate it to others not part of the group.


>**Special Notes:**

>* If someone have a combined role as analyst and participant, it may be may seem benefical for the analyst that the session is recorded. This *observer effect* may however change how the participants behave during the workshop. Trusting a external analyst - i.e. outsider - with the recording may make the participants feel more secure with respect to the fear of group exclusion. The best outcome will however be when the analyst is an internal resource. 
>* It's highly recommended to validate the outcome with the participants or decision maker during the analysis work. 

##### Part 8 - Review 
Its time to perform the review. As some time has past and the participants have had time to reflect on the workshop, it's good practice to start the session by soliciting their thoughts and feedback before the analyst presents his findings. 

The outcome of this meeting is one of three options:

* **Decide:** The participants or decision maker is happy with the results and ready to commit.
* **Iterate:** The participants or decision maker feel more confident with the process, but thinks it further investigation would be beneficial.
* **Terminate:** The participants or decision maker do not see value in proceeding any further with the work.

##### Part 9 - Iterate
Iteration would be to schedule a new workshop. As the participants are more familiar with the process and have already some thoughts about the outcome, the workshop can potentially be cut shorter. 

A different possibility is that group decision can be more challanging to achieve because some of the individual participants may be more commited to their own ideas. 

##### Part 9 - Decide
After the participants feel satisfied with the outcome, it is time to formally commit to them.

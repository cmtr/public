A common mission can help your endevour incraese participants engagement and work towards a common goal

### What you communicate outwards and inwards?

From ping-pong tables in the office to Google's bike meetings, it seems companies everywhere are trying to adopt incentives to build a successful business environment. These incentives, while they may seem great on the surface, have not been proven to retain and engage employees. A successful company culture starts with a defined, tangible mission.

> *It is fundamental to set the tone of the work environment, Employees these days are not as motivated by simply a paycheck. If you want employees who are going to go to battle with and for you, they need to feel connected to a deeper purpose or mission.*
> 
> **Jasmin Terrany**, a psychotherapist and life coach who supports professionals.

Creating a company mission also allows organizations to define what they stand for, which can lead to growth.

To develop the right kind of mission, business owners need to be honest with themselves and look to tangible values beyond profit. These values, or view of the world, can attract the right kind of employees and provide an organization with a framework for success.

> The leader goes first. If you want a culture where people are honest and admit their failures, then you need to be the first one in.

### Part 1 - Define What You Do

The first thing to do is to outline what your endevour does. This may be a good you produce or service you provide to your customers. From a product perspective it may be the pain that is aliviated or the need that is satisfied.

It's important to not just state the obvious here and scratch the surface. The desire is good 

#### Workshop

There is may ways of holding a workshop and many elicitation and decision techniques that can be used to define what you do. The below procedure just represent one way of doing it. It should be seen as a insipiration or guide and tailored to suit you endevours situation.

##### Step  1 - Silent Brainstorm
The first step is to let each participant define what they think your endevour do. The important thing here is to prevent cooperation and group thinking. Hence the participants should not be allowed to speak to each other or peek at eachothers sticky notes. A common way is to provide each participant with a block sticky-note, a pen and the instructions to write down as many of values they can think of within a given time, usually 2-4 minutes.

##### Step 2 - Open Review
Once everybody is ready, it is now time for the open review. Each participant should in turn go up to the whiteboard and present their sticky-notes. The participant should present all their ideas, even if they have been mentioned by somebody else before. Once everybody has presented, the group should discuss the ideas presented. This is also a good time to group related ideas together.

> **Special Note**
> 
> * The group should in advance decide if they want everybody to present first and then comment, or if they want to comment as they go along. Different groups and cultures may have different preferences for such matters.
> * Hearing other peoples suggestions, may trigger new ideas. These should be captured and presented as well.

##### Step 3 - Dive Deeper
The ideas may be of varying degree of specificity. This doesn't in any way wrong, but often the underlay motivation does not come forth.

The Five Why's is a good execise to dig a little deeper and get more ideas.

So lets start with an example of a company making robot vacuum cleaners:
* What do we do? Make Robot Vacuum Cleaners
    * **Why?** To help clean our customers houses
        * **Why?** To help our customers health though a clean living space.
    * **Why?** To automate houshold tasks
        * **Why?** To free up our customers time 
            * **Why?** To allow our customers to do the things they really enjoy
        * **Why?** To stop cohabitants fighting about household tasks.
            * **Why?** To let them have an enjoyable co-existence.

Based on this, we could in addition to making robot vauum cleaners say we are in the business of helping our customers live healthy and enjoyable lifes.

> **Special Note**
> 
> * **_The Five Why's_** can be used in many formes to drill down to the deeper issue. Many people have preferences for how to use the technique, but it's no objective right or wrong way. Find the method that works best for you group. In the above example we made a tree-structure and didn't ask why five times in any of the branches. That is fine, because we found a root cause root early. 
> * As we have not defined our customers yet, the notes with a specific customer type should be made generalized (i.e. call them the customer). The reason for this is avoid unintentional constraints and influence on the participants thinking. If someone states who the customer is during this phase, it's important that the facilitator to emphasize that it's just one of the potential customers and such discussion should be taken in the next phase. Such a statement may influence the participants to try and identify other potential customer in their mind, hence mitigating the effects on the constraint. The facilitator should also note the customer type and acknowledge the contribution. 

##### Step 4 - Prioritization
We have now collected ideas and dived deeper into some of those ideas. It is now time for the group to prioritize the ideas the they find important. We'll start with the *dot voting technique*. Each participant will get a equal amount of small stickers where each represent one vote. The participants are free to spend their votes as they please. This includes not spending them, as well as using multiple votes for the same item. 

It's important to note that this vote is not for elimination of ideas, but to give the group a shared picture of priorities. All the collected ideas should still be in play and the group should also welcome to add new ideas as they come. 

##### Step 5 - Reflection
It's now time for a short reflection

### Part 2 - Define Who You Do It For

Next, describe the way in which your company does what it does. But instead of being technical—that's not the point here—think of what values go into the core of your business. Maybe you value quality or customer service, being sustainable, or you foster creativity and innovation in your business. These are key points to outline in your mission statement.

#### Workshop

The workshop for this phase is equal to the previous phase. If the participants is not familiar with the techniques and this way of working, expect significant improvements to this stage.

### Part 5 - Review, Refine, Validate & Iterate

After you've drafted it, remember to look it over, edit it, and have someone else give it the once over. After you've approved it, you'll need to find a way to incorporate it wherever you can including on your website or as part of your ad campaigns—anywhere that it's visible to your stakeholders.

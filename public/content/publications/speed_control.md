System Two will only take you so far.
It is slow and predictable. 
System One will make mistakes, but will allow you to get there faster

# What speed teaches you to gain control?

Speed and control is often seen in conflict to eachother. 
Speed reduces the level of granularity thus reduces the control.  

When riding a motorcyle off track, the rule invert. 
The surface is unpredictable. 
It is possible to control the bike at low speeds, but it's hard and require a lot of balance.

The same principle appies to downhill skiing. 
When the speed increases it's easier to controll the descent.

All these are a transference from System One to System Two thinking accoring to Hanemans _Thinking fast and Slow_.

## How does speed apply to leadership?
Speed in sports creates a limitation on a persons cognitive abilites.
It forces the subject to forcus on the most important aspect.

In a leadership, it allows the speed slows limits the system two and lets system one - the higher objectictives - to dominate.

# How does speed hinder leadership?
System One thinking requires previous experience. 
Having seen what goes well and not.
High speed with inexperience is still a bad combination.

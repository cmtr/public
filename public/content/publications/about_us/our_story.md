# Our Story

The company was first started in 2018 as a means to grab an opportunity that was too god to refuse. The was when Harald, our founder, was working on transitioning himself into the the information technology sectory. Having put the industry behind him and boldy proclaimed to his associates "*I'll come back if you double my salary*". As history would have it, that was exactly the offer he recieved. 

This is also related to the origin of the companys name. As in most sectors of the corporate world, the Drilling & Wells community, also have a fondness for TLA (*three letter arcronyms*). The short name for the Oil Field Cementing Services was CMT, for which the first 3 letters of our name comes from. The Cementing Service Operators, i.e. fields hands, was colloqoally also refered to as the Cementer. As the fashin of the time for naming start-ups was removing vovles and adding a "r" at the end, we ended up with CMTr. Our founder was very pleased with himself for being clever, but as history would show the contextual and situational understanding required to grasp it was not widely held (even within the cementing community). As our brand is communicated stronger by the individuals of company rather than the company itself, it has never really been a need for changing it. One could say it got cemented in place.

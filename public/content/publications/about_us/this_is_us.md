### This Is Us

Most business are rigged to do their own normalcy. They have over time  specialized their organization, people, processes and culture to create a normalzy that is optimized and incrementally enhanced for generating value for their customers within their niche. Their strenght lay in being rigged to do the same thing in a consisten and continiual manner. These organizations often attracts people that like the opportunities of specialization or predictability they can offer.

The trade off such organization must accept is that they become less flexible, adaptable and agile as due to the inertia of their mindsets, ways of working and earlier commitments and capital investments. 

"*In times of change or upheaval, anyone can make a legitimate business from their own personal vision, however different it may be.*"

Hunter S. Thompson is quated saying, "*When the world changes and becomes strange, those who were previously outside the standards of normality will have an opportunity to become successful.*" And he explains himself, *"When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro, and I have certainly been both in my life. Ask anyone. They know. They remember. They'll tell you that I was both weird and a pro."*

Our mission is _**Helping business do the unfamiliar**_ because we enjoy stepping into the unknown. More importantly we enjoy the journey of turning it into the familiar. We help our clients by joining and guiding them through their journey of turning the unfamiliar to their new normal.

# Objectives and Measures

## The Library Late Fee
Many towns are now moving towards removing the late fees at their libraries 

The objective of the society and municipality was to increase the amount and people to read. 

## The Objectives of the Library
The primary purpose of the public library is to provide resources and
services in a variety of media to meet the needs of individuals and
groups for education, information and personal development including
recreation and leisure. They have an important role in the development
and maintenance of a democratic society by giving the individual access
to a wide and varied range of knowledge, ideas and opinions.

Or as the IFLA/UNESCO Public Library Manifesto (1994) defines it: _The public library, the local gateway to knowledge, provides a basic
condition for lifelong learning, independent decision-making and cul-
tural development of the individual and social groups._ 

### Why does the fee exist?
There are many reason for the fee to exist. 

The first and formost is inertia. Historically media and knowledge repositories - like scrolles and books - used to be expensive and scarece. People not returning the books thus had a negative consequence on other people wanting to access that knowledge. A late fee was thus a effective way of assuring the public good. While the cost of media has dramatically come down since the invention of the printing press and the type of media 


Measuring the right things is difficult. A measure is better than no measure at all. The ratio of unreturned/late books to lending is a easy metric to measure. On the surface it's also many context that such a ratio makes sense to use. The most obvious is in regards to minimizing expenduture. 


## The High Tech Private Vertical Garbage Shoot
In our city the vertical underground garbage shoot has been introduced. These have been specially designed with the purpose to reduce the size of the garbage thrown away and to only allow people with the priviledge to use them

The reason for limiting the size of the garbage thrown away has many benefits for the waste disposal plant. The automated machinery works best when the size is in a given range. The other is that it forces the people that want to throw away larger items to use the larger recycling stations.

The reason for limiting access to a limited number people is simple that it's those people that pay for disposal of that waste.

### The unintended consequences of the design
The first fault in the desing of these was that people act according to rules and procedures. Most people do, but

### What is the objective of the society and the people in it?
A clean neighborhood

## Conclusion
The lack of vision, values and strategy for the desired outcome
The lack of understanding the imperfections of other people.
